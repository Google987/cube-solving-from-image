# cube-solving-from-image

Please read the whole readme file before trying to download, clone or fork.

It was just a weekend project, so it's not at all near finish.
You will need some knowledge of the following thigns to understand and continue with the project:
  1. python3
  2. very little about libraries cv2, rubik-solver
  3. basic flask
  4. javascript
  
to run cube-solving.py install cv2 and rubik-solver

https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/ 

https://pypi.org/project/rubik-solver/

now run the `python3 cube-solving.py`
### output

BTW it's getting images from 'Photos' folder

==============================================================

You can also get the cube info from a webpage. right? instead of doing all this with images.

for this you will need to install flask `pip3 install flask` 
so now you can run `python3 controller.py`
open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser
